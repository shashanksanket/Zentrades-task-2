This React application is designed to import and display product data from a JSON or CSV file. The application allows users to customize the import settings and choose the columns they want to display in a table.

## Problem Statement

**Task:** Download the JSON file from [https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-to-cors/assignment.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-to-cors/assignment.json). The JSON file contains 1000 records of products, each having four attributes: Subcategory, Title, Price, and Popularity.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a UI to import the data in the browser and display it as specified in the provided image file (`Import_products_Screen_1.png`).

2. The UI should have options to handle the display of columns in the table with multi-select functionality.

3. Implement the ">>" and "<<" buttons to add and remove selected options from the Available Fields List to Fields to be displayed List and vice versa.

4. Display the data in a table format of your choice with Title and Price ordered based on descending popularity.

**Deliverables:**

- Hosting URL on Heroku / Github pages.
- Github repository link to your solution.
- Time taken to complete this.
